# Todo App Documentation

## Introduction
This project is a simple **Todo App** built with **React.js**. The app allows users to create a list of tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and add new tasks. It features an easy-to-use interface with modern styling for a pleasant user experience.

### Features:
- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed (strike-through effect)
- Delete tasks from the list
- Minimalistic design with modern UI
- No backend integration (data is stored in the local component state)

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **useState Hook**: React's hook for managing component state.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the UI components.

---

## App Structure

The app is structured as a simple React component and contains the following files:

1. **TodoApp.js**: The main component that renders the entire app, handles state management, and contains the logic for adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.
2. **styles**: Inline styles are used for styling the components to give them a modern and responsive layout.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. If you don’t have them installed, you can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run the App:
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or create a new React app using `create-react-app`:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app todo-app
    cd todo-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: If any external dependencies are needed, you can install them using npm. This app uses React and doesn’t have any additional packages, so there are no extra dependencies to install.

3. **Add the Code**:
   - Copy and paste the code from the `TodoApp.js` into the `src` directory of your project.
   - Update the `App.js` file to render the `TodoApp` component.

4. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This will start the React development server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Functionality and Components

### 1. **State Management**
The app uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the application. It maintains:
- `tasks`: An array of task objects that stores the list of tasks.
- `task`: A string that represents the current task being typed in the input field.

### 2. **Add Task**
The `addTask` function is responsible for adding a new task to the task list. It checks if the input is not empty, and if valid, it adds the new task to the `tasks` state array.

```js
const addTask = () => {
  if (task.trim() !== "") {
    setTasks([...tasks, { task: task, completed: false }])
    setTask("") // Clear input field
  }
}
```

### 3. **Toggle Task Completion**
The `toggleTask` function toggles the `completed` status of a task. When a task is clicked, it will change its status between `completed` and `not completed`. This is reflected in the task's styling (text decoration: strikethrough).

```js
const toggleTask = (index) => {
  const updatedTask = tasks.map((t, i) =>
    i === index ? { ...t, completed: !t.completed } : t
  );
  setTasks(updatedTask);
}
```

### 4. **Delete Task**
The `deleteTask` function removes a task from the `tasks` state. It filters the tasks array to exclude the task at the specified index.

```js
const deleteTask = (index) => {
  setTasks(tasks.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
}
```

### 5. **Rendering Tasks**
Tasks are rendered in a list. Each task displays:
- The task name.
- A "Delete" button to remove the task.
- The ability to toggle the completion status (by clicking on the task).

## Styles

### Inline Styling

The app uses inline styles to maintain a clean and simple structure. Here’s a summary of the main styles applied to the app:

- **Container**: The container has a maximum width of 500px, with auto margin for centering. It has a light background color and some padding.
  
- **Input Fields**: The input field for adding tasks and the buttons are styled with padding, border radius, and background colors to make them visually appealing.

- **Tasks**: Each task is styled to have a shadow and padding for a card-like effect. The `completed` tasks have a background color of light green and text decoration with a line-through effect.




---

## Conclusion

This Todo App is a great example of a simple yet functional application built with React. By using the `useState` hook, the app efficiently manages task data and updates the UI dynamically. The use of inline styling provides an easy way to apply styles and maintain a clean look.

---

### Future Improvements:
- Add persistence by saving the tasks in `localStorage` or a backend database.
- Add user authentication so tasks are linked to specific users.
- Implement task priority or categories.
- Implement drag-and-drop for task ordering. 




Here’s a simple documentation for your Counter project:

**Counter App Documentation**

**Introduction:**
The Counter app is a basic React application that allows the user to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. The app demonstrates the use of React's `useState` hook to manage and update the state dynamically. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the counter.

### **1. Overview**
The Counter app displays a numeric counter with three main buttons:
- A "+" button to increment the counter.
- A "-" button to decrement the counter (with a limit at zero).
- A "Reset" button to set the counter back to zero.

---

### **2. Features**
- **Increment:** Clicking the "+" button increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement:** Clicking the "-" button decreases the counter by 1 (but prevents the counter from going below 0).
- **Reset:** The "Reset" button resets the counter to 0.
- **State Management:** The state is managed using the `useState` hook in React.

---

### **3. Technologies Used**
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState Hook:** React hook for managing the state of the counter variable.
- **JSX:** The syntax used in the component to render the UI.

---

### **4. Code Explanation**

#### **useState Hook:**
The app uses the `useState` hook to track the current count. Initially, the counter is set to `0`. The `setCount` function is used to update the counter when the user interacts with the buttons.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

#### **Increment Button:**
When the "+" button is clicked, the `setCount` function is called to increment the counter by 1.

```javascript
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
```

#### **Decrement Button:**
The "-" button decreases the counter value by 1, but it first checks if the counter is already 0. If the counter is 0, it doesn't decrement further.

```javascript
<button onClick={() => { if (count <= 0) { return 0 } else { setCount(count - 1); } }}>-</button>
```

#### **Reset Button:**
The "Reset" button resets the counter to `0` by calling the `setCount` function with a value of `0`.

```javascript
<button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
```

#### **Rendering the Counter:**
The value of the `count` state is displayed within the `h1` tag, which updates dynamically as the state changes.

```javascript
<h1>{count}</h1>
```

### **5. Setup Instructions**

To set up this project locally:

1. Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.
2. Create a new React app by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app counter-app
cd counter-app
```

3. Replace the contents of the `src/App.js` file with the Counter component code.

4. Run the app using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server, and you can view the Counter app in your browser.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
This is a basic React counter app that demonstrates how to use the `useState` hook for state management in React. By interacting with the buttons, users can increment, decrement, or reset the counter. The app is a simple example for beginners learning how to work with React.
